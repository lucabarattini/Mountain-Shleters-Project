## Contributing
We welcome contributions to the "Mountain House” project. 
At the moment we worked only on the Piemonte region, to optimize the functions and algorithm at its highest. Our aim for the future is to include all the regions of Italy, and perhaps be able to deal even with another country. 
As University students, this journey started as a College Project with academic objectives, as though it is protected by MIT License.
If you have suggestions or improvements, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
